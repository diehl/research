            Recently I participated in <em>The City Resilient</em>, an event organized by PopTech and the Rockefeller Foundation to bring together individuals with diverse backgrounds and experience that share a common interest in advancing the resilience of our communities. Day one of the event consisted of presentations from leading innovators and scholars working on advancing and understanding various aspects of resilience, from the personal to the ecological scale. Day two engaged a smaller group of attendees in a design exercise to generate new concepts that might serve as meaningful responses to the challenges we heard the day prior.

            Not long after I moved into my new apartment, I experienced three separate power outages of significant duration within the span of 24 hours. Since my iPhone was charged and AT&amp;T&rsquo;s network remained operational, I was able to connect with the outside world and inquire about the situation. Given I now live in an area that is primed for earthquakes at any time, I&rsquo;ve thought about how bad the situation could become if a significant event took place.

            Several years ago, I had the opportunity to listen to a retired Marine general who, upon leaving the military, continued to pursue his passion in the area of strategic collaboration. During the course of his military career, at various levels of command, he had seen and wrestled with the challenges of orchestrating the actions of multiple civilian and military organizations in dynamic, uncertain environments. During his presentation, his objective was to discuss the wicked hard problems in the extreme scenarios of disaster recovery and reconstruction events such as post-Hurricane Katrina operations and Iraq reconstruction.

            As Hurricane Gustav bears down on Louisiana, I can not help but think about the challenges of disaster response and how I believe we as a nation can do better. I believe communication technology, including social media, has an important role in this equation. Yet the most fundamental shift that is required is one of mindset.
Following September 11th, the push for homeland security has focused significantly on deploying technology to enhance the capabilities of security personnel and first responders to prevent or mitigate the impact of threats to the nation, whether natural or man-made.
