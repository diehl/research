      <description>With the latest shooting in San Bernardino, it feels like our society is awakening to a new normal — one where the term &lt;em&gt;active shooter&lt;/em&gt; becomes common parlance in our everyday conversation. While the senseless deaths are tragic in their own right, it is similarly tragic to watch the paralyzing and polarizing effects of fear unfold in our society.</description>

      <description>In the mid 90s, while working in government, I was given an invaluable bit of advice from an Air Force colonel who would become a trusted advisor and a dear friend. He said: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perspective is elusive&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with countless Ph.D.&amp;rsquo;s that would obsess over details which did not matter in the grand scheme of things. You seem to have the ability to operate on multiple levels. Don&amp;rsquo;t lose the ability to see the bigger picture.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <description>Senseless tragedies such as the recent Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut give us pause as a nation and leave us struggling to understand how these acts happen all too often. With each loss, I begin to wonder if we are learning as a society. Are we truly reflecting on the problem or are we trapped in the same patterns that prevent us from moving forward? A closer look at how we respond hints at an answer.</description>

      <description>In a January 2011 report, the Economist Intelligence Unit published results from a survey of 300 senior executives from around the globe. The report highlighted a number of key challenges that businesses are grappling with as they face increasing complexity in the business environment. Global businesses serving diverse markets are expected to provide tailored products and more responsive customer service. Meeting these specialized needs while adapting to constraints within each marketplace has complicated decision-making. Meanwhile the timelines for comprehending the risks and making decisions have only grown shorter. How can organizations perform more effectively when faced with these challenges?</description>

      <description>How can technology enhance the performance of organizations? How does one characterize organizational performance in a world where our ability to predict is highly constrained? These are two general questions that have been on my mind for some time now. In an effort to clarify my thoughts on the matter and broaden the discussion, I thought I would summarize my view to date, providing the first of what I expect to be a series of blog posts on this general topic.</description>
