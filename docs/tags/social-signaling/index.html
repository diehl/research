            Consider the following email from Tim Belden to John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen. Recall that Tim Belden was indicted for his role in conceiving and executing various financial schemes that allowed Enron to profit significantly from energy markets. Through the analysis of the Enron email collection, we would like to understand who Belden was reporting to and who he was supervising during the time period of the California energy crisis.

            Each one of us has had the experience. We meet someone for the first time and immediately feel a resonance. We talk about how some people simply radiate, creating a presence that is hard to ignore. The nonverbal communication channel is powerful and shapes outcomes in social situations in profound ways. In recent years, Sandy Pentland&rsquo;s research group at the MIT Media Lab has been systematically studying this communication pathway and characterizing more precisely the impact honest signals have.
